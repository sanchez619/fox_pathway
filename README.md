# Fox Pathway
While doing the Code Institute program, my part-time work as a middle school instructor has proven less fruitful.
The beliefs and techniques regarding learning do not work well in an environment which forces students to learn, especially if they have not themselves learned that the process of acquiring knowledge is nowhere near as difficult as they imagine it to be.
While many teachers develop the habit of blaming the inability of students, I do not want to go down the same path. I believe in the principle which I have laid out on the Memory Gates website.
Thus, it seems only necessary to follow up directly on the website. This document will outline the follow-up website of Memory Gate – Fox Pathway.

General Overview
Fox Pathway is a website which applies the idea of learning by association. The main principle will be Joshua Foer’s “See-Link-Go” principle. A user sees the content, links it with their association and can remember it that way. As its main topic, Fox Pathway will provide a platform for users to learn Japanese Radicals. These radicals make up all the
General Styling & Elements
Continuing the visual metaphor of the Torii Gate, Fox Pathway’s visuals are inspired by the famous “Fushimi Inari Taisha” (or 伏見稲荷大社). To non-Japanese, it is known as the famous temple mountain in Kyoto, where people wander on long paths, on which they pass through numerous smaller gates. Each gate is provided by companies and/or individuals; their names are engraved on the vertical pillars of the gate.
The learning experienced will be framed as a person passing through a set path of Torii gates. Each path represents one radical and a set number of Kanji (in this case 10). For both the radicals and the Kanji, the user creates an association; this association will be saved as string in an array and reviewed as part of a quiz. The input is done via a text field – it will provide the option to create a

Individual webpages:
Index.html
The index site will be a plain input sight. The user chooses a username and enters it into a text. The name will then be used to address the user during his stay on the website.

Menu.html
The menu will consist of a main image rather than a hero image. The image will display the websites mascot, an anime styled fox named “Musubi” – a Japanese word for link. Below him, the user will have the option of multiple link boxes. These will link them to the appropriate webpage they want to used.  A header will provide links to all webpages as well as another link to an about-page.

The aims of this website are to:
help the user gain an understanding for Japanese Kanji
help users learn basic Radicals often used in Japanese writing.
display the benefits of the See-Link-Go Principle for language learning.
provide a platform to create and review the user’s association.

The user of this website:
wants to learn Japanese.
wants assurance that their language ability is enough to learn a language like Japanese.
learn to use their own imagination for language learning.
train their creativity.

Future Improvements:
Naturally, the selection of the website is limited due to time constraints. A full website will contain all radicals as well as a list of the 2000 most used Japanese Kanji.
For learners already versed in Hiragana and Katakana, future version would include separate paths to learning the Japanese and Chinese reading for both the radicals and the kanji.
In an ideal version, an AI generator could immediately generate a picture for the user’s association and save it in an array together with each input from the user.

Once more Joshua Foer’s Memory Superpowers serves as basis for the associative and mnemonic learning principles and techniques.
By suggestion
As reference to how associative learning of Japanese characters may look, the German website Miruko.de has published two articles about learning the two other Japanese writing systems, one for Katakana and Hiragana respectively.
All pictures this time will be AI generated to better suit the style of the website. The Generator used is perchance.org.
The pictures in svg-file-format are provided by “Kanji Alive”, which are generous to provide an open-file Github repository for fonts, characters etc for open access.
Once more, the Favicon was chosen from the supply of Favicon.net, while the Icons used can be found on Fontawesome.net.
